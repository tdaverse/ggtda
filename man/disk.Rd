\usage{
geom_disk(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE,
  radius = NULL,
  diameter = NULL,
  segments = 60L,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, either as a \code{ggproto} \code{Geom} subclass or as a string naming the
stat stripped of the \code{stat_} prefix (e.g. \code{"count"} rather than
\code{"stat_count"})}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string naming the adjustment
(e.g. \code{"jitter"} to use \code{position_jitter}), or the result of a call to a
position adjustment function. Use the latter if you need to change the
settings of the adjustment.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; ignored.}

\item{radius, diameter}{The (positive) radius or diameter used in the
construction. Provide only one of these; if neither is provided, they
default to zero.}

\item{segments}{The number of segments in the regular polygon that
approximates each disk}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}.}
}
\description{
Center disks at points in a scatterplot.
}
\details{
A \emph{ball} of radius \eqn{r} around a point \eqn{x} in Euclidean space consists
of all points whose distances from \eqn{x} are less than \eqn{r}. A ball in 2
dimensions is called a \emph{disk}.

The geometric objects of \code{GeomDisk} can be used to illustrate disk covers of
point clouds, in particular in the construction of simplicial filtrations. It
could be paired with a statistical transformation of \verb{Stat*} that samples
points from a cloud.

The convenience function \code{geom_disk()} produces a layer with the identity
statistical transformation.

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_disk()} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{x}}
\item \strong{\code{y}}
\item \code{alpha}
\item \code{colour}
\item \code{fill}
\item \code{group}
\item \code{linetype}
\item \code{linewidth}
}
Learn more about setting these aesthetics in \code{vignette("ggplot2-specs", package = "ggplot2")}.
