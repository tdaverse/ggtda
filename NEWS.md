# ggtda 0.1.0

This initial CRAN submission extends ggplot2 with the following objects and elements:

- a point cloud data set sampled from a 2-dimensional annulus
- persistence and frontier stat layers for persistence data
- a barcode geom layer for persistence data
- disk, Vietoris skeleton, and Cech skeleton layers for 2-dimensional point cloud data
- tda, persist, and barcode themes

Their functionality is illustrated in several examples and in two vignettes and is validated in several tests using testthat and vdiffr.
