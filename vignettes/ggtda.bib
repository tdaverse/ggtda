  abstract = {We present an algorithm for the computation of Vietoris{\textendash}Rips persistence barcodes and describe its implementation in the software Ripser. The method relies on implicit representations of the coboundary operator and the filtration order of the simplices, avoiding the explicit construction and storage of the filtration coboundary matrix. Moreover, it makes use of apparent pairs, a simple but powerful method for constructing a discrete gradient field from a total order on the simplices of a simplicial complex, which is also of independent interest. Our implementation shows substantial improvements over previous software both in time and memory usage.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we initiate a study of shape description and classification via the application of persistent homology to two tangential constructions on geometric objects. Our techniques combine the differentiating power of geometry with the classifying power of topology. The homology of our first construction, the tangent complex, can distinguish between topologically identical shapes with different "sharp" features, such as corners. To capture "soft" curvature-dependent features, we define a second complex, the filtered tangent complex, obtained by parametrizing a family of increasing subcomplexes of the tangent complex. Applying persistent homology, we obtain a shape descriptor, called a barcode, that is a finite union of intervals. We define a metric over the space of such intervals, arriving at a continuous invariant that reflects the geometric properties of shapes. We illustrate the power of our methods through a number of detailed studies of parametrized families of mathematical shapes.},

  abstract = {Visualization in the emerging field of topological data analysis has progressed from persistence barcodes and persistence diagrams to display of two-parameter persistent homology. Although persistence barcodes and diagrams have permitted insight into the geometry underlying complex datasets, visualization of even single-parameter persistent homology has significant room for improvement. Here, we propose a modification to the conventional persistence diagram - the flat persistence diagram - that more efficiently displays information relevant to persistent homology and simultaneously corrects for visual bias present in the former. Flat persistence diagrams display equivalent information as their predecessor, while providing researchers with an intuitive horizontal reference axis in contrast to the usual diagonal reference line. Reducing visual bias through the use of appropriate graphical displays not only provides more accurate, but also deeper insights into the topology that underlies complex datasets. Introducing flat persistence diagrams into widespread use would bring researchers one step closer to practical application of topological data analysis.},
